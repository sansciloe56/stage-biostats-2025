These are the codes I wrote during my 3-month internship at the IARC between June 2025 until August 2025 for the end of my Master 1 in Econometrics and Statistics at the ISFA. The project I worked on is about cancer avoidance and proteomics.

Here is a list of what can be found in each folder:

- Folder ```001_data_analysis```: the data analyses performed during the project;
- Folder ```002_coxmodel```: the implementation of the Cox P.H. model (```survival``` package), along with the absolute risks computations;
- Folder ```003_riskgroups```: how the participants were ranked in their risk groups;
- Folder ```004_multlogreg_proteins```: using the ANOVA method to filter proteins and applying the multinomial logistic regression models (```glmnet``` package) on the filtered proteins;
- Folder ```005_visualisations_proteins```: plotting the proteins with heatmaps (```pheatmap``` package) to see the comparisons.
