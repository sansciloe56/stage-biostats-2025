These are the codes I wrote during my 3-month internship at the IARC between June 2025 until August 2025 for the end of my Master 1 in Econometrics and Statistics at the ISFA. The project I worked on is about cancer avoidance and proteomics.

Here is a list of what can be found in each folder:

\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] Folder \texttt{001_data_analysis}: the data analyses performed during the project;
  \item[-] Folder \texttt{002_coxmodel}: the implementation of the Cox P.H. model, along with the absolute risks computations;
  \item[-] Folder \texttt{003_riskgroups}: how the participants were ranked in their risk groups;
  \item[-] Folder \texttt{004_multlogreg}: using the ANOVA method to filter proteins and applying the multinomial logistic regression models on the filtered proteins;
  \item[-] Folder \texttt{005_plotsproteins}: plotting the proteins with heatmaps to see the comparisons.
\end{itemize}
